# Disease Prediction from Symptoms ðŸ§ ðŸ’‰
This project predicts diseases based on symptoms using machine learning classification models. It aims to help in early diagnosis and resource prioritization by analyzing user-reported symptoms and predicting probable diseases.
## Problem Statement
Developed a machine learning application to predict diseases based on symptom data. The goal is to:
ïƒ˜	Enable early diagnosis
ïƒ˜	Optimize healthcare resource allocation
ïƒ˜	Improve patient engagement in self-care
## Dataset
I used public datasets from:
â€¢	ColumbiaUniversity:http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html
â€¢	Kaggle: The dataset is a public dataset acquired from Kaggle. It is a raw dataset which consists of Disease, Count of disease occurrence and Symptoms. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset

## Data Preprocessing
â€¢	Removed duplicates and cleaned symptom/disease names
â€¢	Split multi-symptom rows into individual entries
â€¢	Assigned binary values (0/1) for symptom presence
â€¢	Mapped disease labels to rows
## Data Visualization
â€¢	Correlation heatmap between symptoms
â€¢	Correlation heatmap between diseases
## Models Used
### 1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
â€¢	Assumes feature independence
â€¢	Efficient for high-dimensional input

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
â€¢	Captures feature interactions
â€¢	Provides feature importance rankings
## Implementation Steps
â€¢	Train test split
â€¢	Model training and validation
â€¢	Feature importance extraction (from Decision Tree)
## Evaluation & Results
Top symptoms ranked by importance (Decision Tree):
1. loss_of_smell (0.0269)
2. internal_itching (0.0269)
3. hip_joint_pain (0.0268)
## Conclusion
The Decision Tree model provided more accurate predictions due to its ability to capture symptom combinations, unlike Naive Bayes which assumes independence.
